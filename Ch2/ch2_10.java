 * (Science: calculating energy) 
 * Write a program that calculates the energy needed to heat water 
 * from an initial temperature to a final temperature. 
 * Your program should prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial 
 * and final temperatures of the water. The formula to compute the energy is
 * Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184
 * where M is the weight of water in kilograms, temperatures are in degrees Celsius, 
 * and energy Q is measured in joules.
